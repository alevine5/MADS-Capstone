# Zoonotic Forecast: A Data Science Approach to Predicting Viral Spillovers

## Summary
The emergence of zoonotic diseases—illnesses transmitted from animals to humans—poses a serious threat to global health security. Recent outbreaks underscore the urgent need for predictive analytics to preempt viral spillovers. This capstone project leverages data science to map the historical incidence of zoonotic viruses and forecasts future risks. By understanding patterns of past outbreaks and integrating demographic changes, our analysis aims to pinpoint potential hotspots before they flare into human epidemics, aiding policymakers and health organizations in crafting proactive defenses.

## Background Research
Zoonotic pathogens have repeatedly blindsided the human population, with the 21st century witnessing escalations in both frequency and impact. A [notable study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18288193/) by the Zoological Society of London synthesized the global trends of emerging zoonoses, highlighting the role of wildlife as a reservoir. [Another pivotal work](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18288193/) by the UCLA Department of Epidemiology provided a framework for predicting the origins of future zoonotic viruses. Despite these advancements, the field still requires a nuanced risk assessment tool that accounts for evolving human-animal interfaces. Our project builds on these foundations, employing machine learning to assess and forecast zoonotic risk with unprecedented precision.

## Project Visualizations
Visualizations crafted for this project will serve as a window into the progression of zoonotic diseases across the timeline of human history. They will depict the frequency, distribution, and trajectory of past outbreaks, converting complex data into a compelling narrative. The intent is to clarify the role of factors such as demographic shifts and economic developments in disease emergence. We will first use interactive geospatial heat maps to show the risk of this type of emergence over the years, as well as pointing out the major outbreaks of this nature that have occurred in the past. Then, we will use line graphs with confidence intervals to show the trends of the risk scores of each country. Through these visualizations, we aim to show the factors affecting disease emergence, guiding observers in recognizing patterns that signify potential threats.

## Machine Learning Model Application
The heart of our predictive mechanism is a random forest regression model trained to scrutinize regions for zoonotic spill-over potential. This model assimilates diverse datasets, including demographic, economic, and historical epidemiological data to assign risk scores to each country. The outcomes will be translated into heat maps, highlighting areas with elevated risk. Then, we will use k-fold cross validation to derive reasonable confidence intervals for our risk score forecasts. We will demonstrate these predicted risk scores via line graphs. This innovative approach is designed not just to forecast future outbreaks but to empower targeted surveillance and pre-emptive interventions, potentially saving millions of lives by alerting to the rumble of the next pandemic before it roars.
