During the siege of the Genoan fortress of Caffa (today’s Theodosia) in the Crimea, Tatars catapulted the cadavers of their soldiers that had succumbed to plague within (the first “biological warfare”); Genoan mer- chants escaped the fortress but spread the plague to Constantinople and Messina. The ensuing pandemic engulfed the whole Italy, Dalmatia, France, England and Norway in 1348; then Germany and Moravia in 1349; and Poland, Russia (for instance in Smolensk died all citizens except for five persons) in 1350–1351.
