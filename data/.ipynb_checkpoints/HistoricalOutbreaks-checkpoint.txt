When the Athenian navy was dispatched later against Sparta, it was also heavily affected by the disease: one-quarter of 4,000 soldiers died, including the commander Pericles and his two sons. The symptoms described by Thucydides involve high fever, facial erythema, pustular rash to ulcers on the skin (sometimes gangrenes), bleeding from gums, tongue and throat, conjunctivi- tis, cough, sneezing, runny nose, diarrhoea, severe vomiting, dehydration, sleeping distress; and some of those who survived lost their toes and fingers, vision or memory. According to the symptoms and some epidemiological features, as the most probable cause of this epidemic could be regarded epidemic louse-borne typhus, while plague is improbable; additional alternative hypotheses have included ergotism or smallpox; some authors also considered (but as much less probable causes) abdominal typhus, malaria, dengue, WN fever, Ebola haemorrhagic fever, CCHF, gastrointestinal anthrax or brucellosis. (In our opinion, a combination of epidemic typhus with ergotism is a feasible hypothesis). In any event, this outbreak contributed significantly to the decline of Athens.
