    "In this notebook, we build an animated, interactive choropleth with Plotly to visualize the data from Hubálek and Rudolf in our Dash application. We start by reading in the pickled DataFrame that we created in Historical_Data_Cleaning.ipnyb. We then format the \"Description\" column of the DataFrame to work with Plotly, and define a function that outputs our final visual. We also create a static image of our visual using Kaleido, a library developed by Plotly to export static images of plots. Kaleido typically needs to be installed separately from Plotly but does not require a separate import statement."

    "Our goal with this visualization is to demonstrate the scale of the problem that zoonotic diseases pose to humanity. Our data is limited in that we do not have detailed, consistent, and accurate counts of total cases and health outcomes for each outbreak. But the data is interesting in that it is capable of telling a story throughout recorded human history of where and when outbreaks have occurred. Keep in mind that the descriptions of each event are from a summary from Hubálek and Rudolf, and that the data only includes outbreaks that have been recorded. Just because an area of the world did not record an outbreak in a given year does not necessarily mean that an outbreak did not occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish our goal, we plan to create an animated choropleth showing outbreaks over time with the following properties:\n",
    "- encoded variables (expressiveness):\n",
    "    - Country (political boundaries on map, hoverdata)\n",
    "    - Outbreak Year (hoverdata, combination of color and current year)\n",
    "    - Years Since the Outbreak (color, hoverdata)\n",
    "    - Outbreak description (hoverdata)\n",
    "- interactivity:\n",
    "    - play/pause buttons for the animation\n",
    "    - slider to manually select year\n",
    "    - ability to adjust year range, past years shown, and animation speed when calling the function to create the visual. These arguments will be useful in our dash app.\n",
    "- effectiveness:\n",
    "    - clearly shows which countries are experiencing an outbreak in a given year\n",
    "    - clearly shows which countries have experienced an outbreak in recent years\n",
    "    - demonstrates the constant and global nature of the problem\n",

    "### Conclusion and Ethical Considerations\n",
    "Our visualization accomplishes our goal of demonstrating the nature and scale of the problem of zoonotic outbreaks throughout history. However, it is incredibly important to understand the limitations of the data that we used to create it. Many countries are not mentioned at all in the story told by Hubálek and Rudolf - a result of either a lack of reporting and record keeping or their own biases, but certainly not a lack of outbreaks. It is easy to watch our animation and assume that outbreaks are primarily a problem in Europe, Asia, and North America. Our worry is that this will lead observers to conclude that our efforts to combat them should be directed towards those areas of the world, when in reality areas under-represented in the data, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, are more in-need of help. In the future, it would be great to incorporate more complete data that includes case counts, deaths, how each multi-country outbreak spread, and more outbreaks representing more countries. Still, thank you for reading our work and we hope you enjoyed and learned something from our visualization."
